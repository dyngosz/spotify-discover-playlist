Java application enabling copying Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist to your own easily

#### Idea

Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist is brought users every Monday. 
Its contents are always amazing thanks to innovative automated music recommendation alogorithms.
Unfortunately, this playlist is only available for a certain amount of time: a week.
This application serves as a tool to make it easy to import all the tracks from Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist 
into user's own playlist.

There are few apps already existing like [Mixkeepr](http://www.mixkeepr.com/) or [SaveDiscoverWeekly](http://www.savediscoverweekly.com).

This is my own attempt using [Spotify Web JAVA API](https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-java).
